Compose every section separately and then use \include within the main .tex document, so create a repo with a main.tex document and then a folder with chapters and one for images to be able to also link those up. If decide to export from org mode use a custom setup file to teach org mode how to export the file like it is done [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qHloGTT8XE][here.]] Software wise remember to download ispell and make it work and then also download basictex and livetex using brew, these contain many packages useful for tex-pdf conversion. Remember that when exporting, the pdf will be saved in the same location of the org file from which it was originated.
Use instead of the article class the report class, which in theory should look better for a longer document.
